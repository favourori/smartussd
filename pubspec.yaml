# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/mtn.jpg
   - assets/images/bg1.jpg
   - assets/images/airtel.png
   - assets/images/banner1.png
   - assets/images/balance.png

   - assets/images/buy.png
   - assets/images/bank.ico
   - assets/images/internet.png
   - assets/images/bus.png
   - assets/images/electricity.png


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Regular.ttf

    - family: Mali
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mali-Regular.ttf

    - family: Roboto-Mono
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
          # style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
